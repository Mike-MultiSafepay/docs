2. Enable Tokenization via _Stores->Configuration->MultiSafepay->MultiSafepay Settings_.

Note: 
The Tokenization feature is not available for the Credit Card gateway. 
One is required to enable the Visa, MasterCard and/or Maestro gateways separately in order to have this feature and the _"Save Card"_ option available during the checkout process.
