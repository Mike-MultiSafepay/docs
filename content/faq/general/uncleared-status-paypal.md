In your MultiSafepay Control, you may see PayPal transactions which have the status 'Uncleared' without a reason. This is due to a configuration in your PayPal business account regarding currencies.

The 'Uncleared' transactions are paid in a currency that is not enabled in your PayPal account. It is important to enable that specific currency in your PayPal account in order for the order status to change to 'Completed' in your MultiSafepay Control.
