MultiSafepay processes Euro as a standard [currency](/faq/general/which-currencies-are-supported-by-multisafepay).
Our Magento 1 plugin is developed based on this.

However, if your webshop uses a different currency, simply change the configuration in the plugin settings:<br>
_System->Configuration->MultiSafepay x.x.x->Connect Settings->Allow currency conversion to Euro->No_.
