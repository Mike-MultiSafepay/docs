A recurring transaction can only be refunded to the customer when the financial status of the transaction is marked as completed. The refund can be processed as followed:

1. Select _transaction -> transaction overview in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)_
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select _refund_
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer
6. _Confirm_ the refund.

_MultiSafepay does not allow you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction_

The transaction status is now initialized, as long as the transaction status is marked as initialized, the refund can be cancelled.
When the transaction status is changed to completed, the refund is fully processed.
The customer will receive the refund on the bank account number with which the original transaction was paid with the next business day.
