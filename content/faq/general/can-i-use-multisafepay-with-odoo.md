Yes you can. There are some external developers that made an Odoo app that connects with MultiSafepay.
You can find it on the [Odoo website](https://www.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?search=multisafepay)

MultiSafepay did not develop the Odoo apps. Therefore, we advise you to contact your developer to assist you further.
