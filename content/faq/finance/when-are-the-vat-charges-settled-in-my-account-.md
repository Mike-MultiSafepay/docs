The VAT is automatically deducted from your account balance at the end of the month. You can look up exact amounts by using ‘VAT or 'Invoice’ as a search query in your transaction overview. You will receive your invoice by email. Additionally, all VAT invoices will be added to your account. The invoice is for administrational purposes only; you do not need to settle the amount separately.
