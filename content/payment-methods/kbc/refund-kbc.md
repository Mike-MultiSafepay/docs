# Request refund
Please follow the following steps to refund a KBC transaction.

1. Select _transaction -> transaction overview in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/)
2. Find the transaction through search
3. Open transaction
4. Select refund
5. Fill in the amount that you want to refund to the customer  
6. _Confirm the refund_.

_MultiSafepay does not allow you to refund more than the stated amount of the original transaction_


The transaction status is now _Initialized_. As long as the transaction is marked as _Initialized_ the refund can be cancelled.
When the transaction status is marked as _Completed_, the refund is processed correctly.
The customer will receive the refund to the bank account attributed to the original transaction within the next business day.

>_Refunds will not be processed when your MultiSafepay balance is insufficient_.

We do not automatically receive the IBAN when a transaction is completed.
However we import our bank statements daily and all incoming payments which have not been completed yet will then be completed.
Refunds can therefore be done after 1 business day.

When you are not able to refund a KBC transaction, contact our support <support@multisafepay.com> to assist you further.
