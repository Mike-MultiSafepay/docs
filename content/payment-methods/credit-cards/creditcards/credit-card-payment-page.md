# Integrating our credit card payment page
By bundling all the credit cards in the checkout, you would save space and hide all the different credit card providers.

The customer will be redirected to a credit card payment page. The customer will then be requested to fill in their credit card credentials and we will automatically detect which credit card is being used based on the first couple of digits. 

For example, 3753 would indicate an American Express transaction. To implement this, check out our  [credit card API page](/api/#credit-cards).
