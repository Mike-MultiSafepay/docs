Since 2016, MultiSafepay has expanded its payment services by including so-called acquiring services for some payment methods. This means that for payment methods such as Bancontact, MultiSafepay can offer end-to-end payment processing and reporting services, which contributes to  increased availability and reliability.  As a result, we are required to start charging VAT per 1 January 2017.

If MultiSafepay can include your local VAT registration number in its monthly invoice, standard Dutch VAT of 21% can be shifted and will therefore not be charged to you.
