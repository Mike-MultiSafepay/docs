## MultiSafepay Test Environment

Have you recently thought about using MultiSafepay as your payment service provider? It is now possible to create a [test account](https://testmerchant.multisafepay.com/signup?_ga=2.239314307.1689046699.1579505297-896219683.1574159857) free of charge to have a clear overview of what MultiSafepay has to offer for its merchants.

After creating a test account, you will be able to test several functionalities of the MultiSafepay Merchant Panel. This includes:

* __Dashboard__: Overview of website sales, recent transactions and account balances.
* __Finance__: Select when you would like to be paid out and fund your account manually.
* __Transactions__: A clear overview of your transactions and uncleared transactions.
* __Settings__: Customize a number of functionalities of your website including e.g. email templates and payment methods.
* __Reports__: Create advanced financial reports tailored to your requirements.
* __Tools__: Handy tools including a Payment link generator and logo designer

For testing, you may use the [test credentials](https://docs.multisafepay.com/faq/getting-started/test-payment-details/) on our documentation page.
