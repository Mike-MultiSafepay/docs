You can edit the email address in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com) by selecting the drop-down-menu in the right hand corner of your screen next to the search bar.

Click on _Contact Details_ and add your preferred email address under _Financial email_.

Click _Save_ to complete the changes. Reverse-charging VAT is possible in the event that you use our payment services, but are registered as a non-Dutch company.
