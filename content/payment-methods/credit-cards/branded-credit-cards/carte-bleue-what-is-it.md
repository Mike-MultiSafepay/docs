## What is it?
Carte Bleue - a Visa co-branded product - is one of the best-known and most commonly used French credit cards. Every credit card with the 'Verified by Visa' logo can be safely used for online payments.

## How does it work?
Carte Bleue payments are processed through the Visa gateway.

For Carte Bleue to be available as a payment method on the payment page of MultiSafepay, the following are required:

1. The Visa gateway needs to be enabled
