Partner compensation can only be paid after the partner account has been fully activated. Before that you can make full use of the [Partner Dashboard](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) and you will receive partner compensation from connected merchants.

Follow the step-by-step plan in your partner account by going to _activation_ and uploading the necessary documents.

* Copy ID
* Copy a bank statement or transfer 1 euro
* UBO statement.

It takes an average of 3 working days before the account is fully activated.
