## What it is

Apple Pay is a digital wallet service that allows mobile payments to be executed in an easy and secure fashion. Consumers complete payments by using near-field-communication (NFC) embedded in their iOS Apple devices the same way one would use their contactless credit or debit card.

Apple Pay is offered in a number of countries worldwide including the majority of Europe, United States and Canada. A full list of the countries supported can be found here.
