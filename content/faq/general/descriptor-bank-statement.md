A descriptor allows you to display your company name on a customers' bank statement. This can be enabled in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) by following these steps:

1. Navigate to _Settings_ --> _Website settings_
2. Fill in your company name in the field _Name_

The descriptor is applicable for iDEAL, VISA, Mastercard, Banccontact

_Please note that the new name may only be maximum 35 characters._
