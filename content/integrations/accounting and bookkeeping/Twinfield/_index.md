### How to generate an Accountant Export Report

It is possible to generate an Accountant Export Report in your MultiSafepay Control. We invite you to follow these steps:

1. Login to your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/) account
2. Go to Reports and select Accountant export
3. Fill in the date selection
4. Change the report type to MT940 format
5. Generate report

In the Accountant Export Report, all incoming and outgoing completed transactions are displayed in the specified period in which you generate the report. Therefore, you will have an insight into every processed and completed transaction, as well as their associated costs.
