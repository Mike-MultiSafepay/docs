# How does it work?
>_Maestro payments are processed as a credit card payment. Therefore, credit card payments must be enabled within your MultiSafepay Control to process a Maestro payment. Submit your request to enable credit cards (Visa, Mastercard en Maestro) to your account manager or contact us at <sales@multisafepay.com>_

A Maestro payment is always validated with the 3D secure code. The 3D secure is a requirement of Maestro.

## Transaction flow
The transaction flow shows the different possibilities a transaction is able to process. This differs per payment method.

* Order status      
The order status indicates the status of the order, such as completed, pending or rejected. 
The order status is independent of the incoming or outgoing payment of the transaction.     

* Transaction status      
The transaction status indicates the payment status of the transaction, such as pending, completed or rejected. 
Once the transaction status shows as completed, the amount of the transaction is added to your MultiSafepay balance.

Credit card transactions received by MultiSafepay, will be processed through our fraud filter. The following statuses are important when receiving a credit card payment:

| Order Status                      | Transaction Status      | Description |
