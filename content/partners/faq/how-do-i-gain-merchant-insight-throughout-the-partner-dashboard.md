You can ask merchants for access, using the _Request rights_ button. The merchant will then receive an email which he can agree to your request. Than follow the steps below:

1. Login to the Merchant account and navigate to _Settings -> User management_.
2. Select Partner under _Affiliates_.
3. Change status to _Active_ and click _Save_.

You can then log in to the customer's account to view transactions, make refunds or do technical integrations.
