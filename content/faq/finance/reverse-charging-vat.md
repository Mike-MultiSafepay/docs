Reverse-charging VAT is possible in the event that you use our payment services, but are registered as a non-Dutch company.

To reverse-charge VAT it is important that your VAT number is registered at MultiSafepay. You cannot reverse-charge VAT if your VAT number is unknown to MultiSafepay.

To register your VAT number, please send an email to <invoice@multisafepay.com>
