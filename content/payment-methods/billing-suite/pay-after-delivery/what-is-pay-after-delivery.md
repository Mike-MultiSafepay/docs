# What is it?
It's a deferred payment method meaning that the order flow and financial flow are not tied directly in a sequential order, so that the customers can receive the product prior to the payment of the product. This is possible by using a risk based model per order and customer to handle the orders which MultiSafepay will bear the risk of.

>_Pay After Delivery is very customer friendly, increase customer confidence, and increases conversion for the merchant_.
