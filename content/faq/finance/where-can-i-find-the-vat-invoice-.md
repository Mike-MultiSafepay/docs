You can find your monthly VAT invoice in MultiSafepay Control. Log in on your account and navigate to _Finance>Invoices_.

The VAT invoice is also sent to the email address listed under _Financial email_ in your MultiSafepay Control. If you have not added an email address under _Financial email_, your invoices will be sent to the main email address as listed in your account.

You can add a financial email address by selecting _Contact Information_ in your account and adding your preferred email addresses.
