# Activate
KBC is a standard payment method.

The payment method KBC can be activated in your MultiSafepay Control under _settings -> payment methods_.
Enable KBC as payment method in your ecommerce platform to finalize the activation.

> The payment method KBC can only be processed on our new Payment page starting with [PayV2](/tools/payment-pages/what-is-payv2/).

If KBC is not visible as a payment method in your MultiSafepay Control, you can contact the support department at MultiSafepay to assist you further.

>_Note: Before a payment method is activated, check whether the payment method is supported by your ecommerce platform and your MultiSafepay Control_.
