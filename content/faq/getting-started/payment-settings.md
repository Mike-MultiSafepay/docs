There are two ways to activate a payment method in your [MultiSafepay Control](https://merchant.multisafepay.com/).
The most common way is through _settings_ and _payment methods_.
This enables the payment method for all the websites connected to your MultiSafepay Control.

When choosing to enable a payment method at site level, it is important to enable all desired payment methods per site.

>_Please note: With every new payment method you want to add, it is important that payment methods are also enabled at site level._
