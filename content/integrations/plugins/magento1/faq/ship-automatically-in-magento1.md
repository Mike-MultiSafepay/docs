Within our Magento 1 plugin, it is possible to set order to 'Shipped' automatically through our API. This is needed to capture the money from AfterPay, E-invoicing, Klarna, Pay After Delivery and Santander.

Login on the admin of your webshop and navigate to _System->Configuration->MultiSafepay x.x.x->Connect Settings_. In the specific gateway settings, look for 'Send shipped status after complete order'. This setting is located at the bottom.
